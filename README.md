# IR-Term-Project--Tuba-Javaria-Sadaf
We apply classifiers named rocchio, naive bayes, knn on databases dbworld, sentence_Corpus,health_tweets. 
Software used for classification is jupyter notebook 3.6 and libraries used are 
1) Pandas
2) Numpy
3) Sklearn
4) nltk
5) spacy
Dataset dbworld and sentence_corpus are labelled whereas health_tweets are unlablled datasets.
download these python files and run on jupyter notebook block by block and accuracy is calculated.
In case of health_tweets run click on pre-processing, topic modelling.ipynb from browser window opened by jupyter command.
and run the code block by block and see the output. Download the packages while running the code that are required.
This code will create labels for given dataset. After labeling, NextKNN Roccio Naive-bayes.ipynb. and execute block by block.
